The list of dangerous projects is growing longer and longer with no time to respond by civil society, especially on how to preserve their legacy content and valuable history documents, whether in digital or traditional formats. </p>\n<p>A team of digital activists are working on an new initiative, collaborating with this project, to develop some open tools to preserve these historical cluster of content, and set up an example and model to be used by any similar social/political environment. </p>\n<p>The goal of this initiative is to collect the extinct content from those organizations and create an online archive at the beginning, then technologies will be used to keep the content last for a visible duration(10 years and on), and eventually shared and safeguarded by public crowd. </p>\n<p>The extending goal of the project is to make such a preservation a common model by open-source all the details(except the participant's private information). Hence it can be reused by other similar projects. </p>\n<h2 id=\"references\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#references\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>references</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/free-media-in-hong-kong-almost-completely-dismantled-report?CMP=twt_a-world_b-gdnworld\">Free media in Hong Kong almost completely dismantled</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2022/04/25/breaking-hong-kongs-human-rights-press-awards-cancelled/\">Hong Kong’s Human Rights Press Awards cancelled, citing legal risks</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220505015738/https://hongkongfp.com/2022/05/03/world-press-freedom-day-hong-kong-nosedives-in-press-freedom-ranking-below-cambodia-somalia-sri-lanka/\">World Press Freedom Day: Hong Kong nosedives in press freedom ranking – below Cambodia, Somalia, Sri Lanka</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1\">SHKO(Save Hong Kong Online)</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","title":"SHKO(Save Hong Kong Online)","desc":"","updated":1650946407329,"created":1648525691085,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"2b86c1076b19a68a88243e5002a6b2cb","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"background","alias":"the vast disappearing of civil society and independent media","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":129,"offset":346},"end":{"line":5,"column":206,"offset":423},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"background"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"sites","alias":"websites or online causes","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":34,"offset":864},"end":{"line":16,"column":71,"offset":901},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"sites"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"howto","alias":"contribute","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":201,"offset":1031},"end":{"line":16,"column":223,"offset":1053},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"howto"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"sponsorship","alias":"sponsor","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":246,"offset":1076},"end":{"line":16,"column":271,"offset":1101},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"sponsorship"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"sites.appledaily","alias":"sites.appledaily","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":3,"offset":1152},"end":{"line":19,"column":23,"offset":1172},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"sites.appledaily"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"pfy4h1nwep9age7eg0u8xe1","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"sites.inmediahk","alias":"sites.inmediahk","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":3,"offset":1187},"end":{"line":20,"column":22,"offset":1206},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"sites.inmediahk"}}],"anchors":{"goals":{"type":"header","text":"Goals","value":"goals","line":14,"column":0,"depth":2},"quick-facts":{"type":"header","text":"Quick Facts","value":"quick-facts","line":20,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["fzfda8r3h330gsr6wg5db9w","dr6y9n9s72kljfnr7bpwvqj","iu6nr9qel896bjhbckfl05d","vzihkvznemcaaef2br0s1co","wx39zljncctue32jn06u29u","brr1zrug1jl02gi80d1dv8c"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n[![Great Extinction](./assets/extinctions.jpeg)](https://hongkongfp.com/2021/11/28/explainer-over-50-groups-gone-in-11-months-how-hong-kongs-pro-democracy-forces-crumbled/) \n> (_Courtesy: Hong Kong Freepress, 2021_)\n\nSHKO (Save Hong Kong Online) is a community project to preserve those disappearing online web sites since 2019 and in a wake of [[the vast disappearing of civil society and independent media | background]].
